# react-mobx-spreadsheet
Simple React spreadsheet component based on Mobx. It is string based and enables the user to enter arbitrary JS code in the cells, eg.:

```javascript
=> SHEET.rows[1][0].value
```

This will get the value from the first cell of the first row. Unlike eg. Excel these cells require *=>* to be marked as formulas.

This is an educational project not to be used anywhere.
